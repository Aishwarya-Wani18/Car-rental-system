# Car Rental System Using Python

This Car Rental System is a console-based application developed using Python. It allows users to rent cars by booking, picking up, and returning vehicles, while an admin can manage the car data, including adding, deleting, updating, and viewing car details. The system demonstrates the usage of **File Handling** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

## Features

### Admin Features:
- **Add Car**: Admin can add new cars to the system, providing details such as car model, availability, and price.
- **Update Car**: Admin can update car details (e.g., price, availability, etc.).
- **Delete Car**: Admin can remove cars from the system.
- **View Car Data**: Admin can view all available cars and their details.
- **Search car** : Admin can search Car using Car number or Car model 

### User Features:
- **Book Car**: Users can book a car for a rental period.
- **Pick Up Car**: Users can pick up the car theyâ€™ve booked.
- **Return Car**: Users can return the rented car after the rental period is over.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language for developing the system.
- **File Handling**: Used to store and manage car data in text files.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: The system is designed using object-oriented principles like classes and objects to represent cars and users.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Future Improvements
- Implement a database (e.g., SQLite) instead of file handling for data storage.
- Add user authentication for secure login.
- Improve UI with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) using libraries like Tkinter.
